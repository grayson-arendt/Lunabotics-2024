/**
 * \brief Orchestra is used to play music through devices. It uses a "Chirp" (.chrp)
 * music file that can be generated using Phoenix Tuner. Chirp files are generated
 * from standard MIDI files.
 *
 * Any Chirp file located in the src/main/deploy directory of your FRC project will
 * automatically be copied to the roboRIO on code deploy.
 *
 * The robot must be enabled to play music. Additionally, devices playing in Orchestra
 * will not run any other control requests while Orchestra is running. Users can #Pause
 * or #Stop the Orchestra to re-enable device control.
 *
 * \details Each device can only play a single track within the music file. For multi-track
 * files, multiple devices are needed. Devices can be added with an explicit track
 * number. Otherwise, the first track will be played through the first Talon FX added,
 * the second track will be played through the second Talon FX added, etc.
 *
 * To use Orchestra:
 * - Add the Talon FXs to be used as instruments using #AddInstrument.
 * - Load the Chirp file to be played using #LoadMusic.
 * Both of these can also be done in the Orchestra constructor.
 *
 * Once ready, the Orchestra can be controlled using #Play/#Pause/#Stop. New music
 * files can be loaded at any time.
